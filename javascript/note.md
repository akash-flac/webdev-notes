## var vs let vs const
- `var` declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- `var` variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; `let` variables can be updated but not re-declared; `const` variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
- They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while `var` variables are initialized with `undefined`, `let` and `const` variables are not initialized.
- While `var` and `let` can be declared without being initialized, `const` must be initialized during declaration.
