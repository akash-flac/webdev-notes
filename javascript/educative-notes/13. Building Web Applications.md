# How the Web Works?
## Web servers
To view a website online, it has to be published on a server. A server is a special kind of machine whose task is to listen and answer to the demands of clients. A server that publishes resources on the Web is logically called a web server.

More precisely, a web server machine runs a particular software program (also called a web server) able to publish websites. The most popular ones are [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) , [Microsoft IIS](https://www.iis.net/), and [nginx](http://nginx.org/).

## Web clients
The machine asking a server for a resource is called a web client. Actually, the real client is a software program running on the machine. A well-known type of web client is the browser, a program specialized in displaying web pages. Famous web browsers include [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/fr).

Not all web clients are browsers, through. For example, search engines robots and mobile applications also contact servers and ask them for content.

## Communications between clients and servers
Data exchange between client and server
- The client starts the exchange, which sends a request to the server to access a particular web resource.
- The server prepares a result for the request.
- The server sends back this result to the client.
To understand each other, web clients and servers use a standard protocol called HTTP.

# HTTP, the Web Protocol
HTTP, which stands for _HyperText Transfer Protocol_, is the technical foundation of the World Wide Web. It is a protocol, a language that allows two machines to communicate with each other.

> HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP.

Technically speaking, HTTP is a pretty simple protocol based on _textual commands_.

## Anatomy of an HTTP request
The HTTP request comes under the form as a multi-line piece of text similar to the following one.
```
GET / HTTP/1.1  
Host: xkcd.com  
Accept: text/html 
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)
```

The most important line is the first one. It contains:

- The HTTP _method_ (the request type, also named _command_). Here, the `GET` method indicates a resource access request.
- The requested _resource_. Here, `/` (root symbol) indicates a request for the default document.
- The HTTP protocol _version_, here 1.1. 

The other lines of text are called _header fields_. They give more information about the client request: server name (`Host`), accepted content types (`Accept`), client software details (`User-Agent`). They are many other possible header fields.

The main HTTP methods are `GET` to access a resource and `POST` to push some information on the server. Other ones exist, such as `HEAD`, `PUT` or `DELETE`

## Anatomy of an HTTP response
When receiving an HTTP request, the server looks inside for information. It then builds an appropriate answer and sends it back.

The HTTP response sent by the server looks something like this.

```
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK    
 Date: Fri, 22 Apr 2017 18:05:05 GMT   
 Server: Apache/2.2    
 Content-Type: text/html    
 
 <html>    
 <!-- HTML code of the page -->    
 <!-- ... -->    
 </html>
```

The first line contains the response _status_: a three-digit number indicating the request result. Other lines are header fields (`Date`, `Content-Type`, etc) giving additional info about the response.

An HTTP response might also include data. In this example, it contains the HTML code of the web page corresponding to the requested resource.

# HTTP Status Codes & URL
The HTTP status codes belong to different families, depending on their first digit.

## Addressing a resource with a URL

Web sites are usually accessed using their address, a piece of text of the form `http://www.mywebsite.com/myresourcepath/myresource`. This address can be split into several subparts

- `http://` means an access through the HTTP protocol.
- `www.mywebsite.com` is the _domain name_ of the web site.
- `/myresourcepath/myresource` is the _path_ of the requested resource.

An address like this one is called a URL, or _Uniform Resource Locator_. A URL uniquely describes a web resource and the way to request it.

# From Web Sites to Web Apps
## The web development models
In a traditional web development scenario, when you click a link or submit a form, your browser sends a request to the server that returns a full new web page tailored to your request. This model is subject to longer load times and limited interactivity.

Another web development model aims to avoid transmitting a whole new page for each user action. Here’s how things work in that model:

- User actions on the page are intercepted through JavaScript event handlers.
- HTTP requests are sent to the server without interrupting the navigation on the page.
- Only the needed portions of the page are updated with the requests’ results.

Albeit more challenging, this web development model can lead to limited resource loads, improved interactivity and a user experience nearly on par with native applications.

The set of technologies enabling the creation of web applications is codenamed **AJAX** (_Asynchronous JavaScript_ and XML). An AJAX call is an asynchronous HTTP request made to retrieve or send data from/to a server.

## Synchronous vs asynchronous requests

In a _synchronous_ exchange, the asker waits until he gets the needed info. A telephone call is an example of a synchronous exchange.

On the contrary, the asker in an _asynchronous_ exchange can do something else while waiting for the completion of his request. Email is an example of an asynchronous exchange.

The traditional web development model uses synchronous requests: the web client is blocked while waiting for the server to complete its request. The AJAX model uses asynchronous requests: data is fetched when needed in the background.

## Cross-domain requests

For security reasons, many websites have a conservative policy regarding AJAX requests. This same origin policy states that requests are limited to their origin domain: `"http://mysite"` cannot send a request to `"http://anothersite"`. This prevents some servers to be accessible via AJAX calls.

Enabling cross-domain requests is done by setting on cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in the server configuration.

# JSON, a Data Format for the Web
The “X” letter in AJAX stands for XML, a generic markup language that used to be the standard for cross-platform data exchanges. While still in use, XML is quite verbose and tends to be replaced by JSON as the standard data format on the web.

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a textual syntax for describing structured information. As you’ll see in the following example, JSON borrows heavily from the JavaScript object syntax.

```
{
  "cars": [
    {
      "model": "Peugeot",

      "color": "blue",

      "registration": 2012,

      "checkups": [2015, 2017]
    },

    {
      "model": "Citroën",

      "color": "white",

      "registration": 1999,

      "checkups": [2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013]
    }
  ]
}
```

A JSON document is a set of name/value pairs. Name is always within double quotes “”. Values can be numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or objects.
