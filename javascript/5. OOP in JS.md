## Javascript Classes
Most object-oriented languages use classes as _abstractions_ for the ideas or concepts manipulated by a program. A _class_ is used to create objects representing a concept. It offers a convenient syntax to give both _data_ and _behavior_ to these objects. JavaScript is no exception and supports programming with classes (but with a twist — more on that later).

### Create a class
Our example RPG deals with characters, so let’s create a `Character` class to express what a character is.
```javascript
class Character {
  constructor(name, health, strength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.health = health;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.xp = 0; // XP is always zero for new characters
  }
  // Return the character description
  describe() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.health} health points, ${this
      .strength} as strength and ${this.xp} XP points`;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates several key facts about JavaScript classes:

- A class is created with the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class (usually starting with an uppercase letter).
- Contrary to object literals, there is no separating punctuation between the elements inside a class.
- A class can only contain methods e.g. describe(), not data properties.
- Like with object literals, the `this` keyword is automatically set by JavaScript inside a method and represents _the object on which the method was called_.
- A special method named `constructor()` can be added to a class definition. It is called during object creation and is often used to give it data properties.

### Using a class
Once a class is defined, you can use it to create objects.

```javascript
class Character {
  constructor(name, health, strength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.health = health;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.xp = 0; // XP is always zero for new characters
  }
  // Return the character description
  describe() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.health} health points, ${this
      .strength} as strength and ${this.xp} XP points`;
  }
}

const aurora = new Character("Aurora", 150, 25);
const glacius = new Character("Glacius", 130, 30);
// Aurora is harmed by an arrow
aurora.health -= 20;

// Aurora gains a strength necklace
aurora.strength += 10;
// Aurora learns a new skill
aurora.xp += 15;
console.log(aurora.describe());
console.log(glacius.describe());
```

The `aurora` and `glacius` objects are created as characters with the `new` operator. This statement calls the class constructor to initialize the newly created object. After creation, an object has access to the properties defined inside the class. Here’s the canonical syntax for creating an object using a class. Example:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor(param1, param2, ...) {
    this.property1 = param1;
    this.property2 = param2;
    // ...
  }
  
  method1(/* ... */) {
    // ...
  }

  method2(/* ... */) {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

const myObject = new MyClass(arg1, arg2, ...);
myObject.method1(/* ... */);
// ...
```

### JavaScript’s object-oriented model

To create relationships between objects, JavaScript uses _prototypes_.
In addition to its own particular properties, any JavaScript object has an internal property which is a link (known as a _reference_) to another object called its _prototype_.
When trying to access a property that does not exist in an object, JavaScript tries to find this property in the prototype of this object. Here’s an example (borrowed from Kyle Simpson’s great book series You Don’t Know JS).

```javascript
const anObject = {
  myProp: 2
};

// Create anotherObject using anObject as a prototype
const anotherObject = Object.create(anObject); 
console.log(anotherObject.myProp); // 2
```

In this example, the JavaScript statement `Object.create()` is used to create the object `anotherObject` with object `anObject` as its prototype.

> Note: The Object.create() is a built-in function in JavaScript.

```javascript
// Create an object linked to myPrototypeObject 
const myObject = Object.create(myPrototypeObject);
```

When the statement `anotherObject.myProp` is run, the `myProp` property of `anObject` is used since `myProp` doesn’t exist in `anotherObject`.

If the prototype of an object does not have a desired property, then the search continues in the object’s own prototype until we get to the end of the _prototype chain_. If the end of this chain is reached without having found the property, an attempted access to the property returns the value `undefined`.

```javascript
const anObject = {
  myProp: 2
};

// Create anotherObject using anObject as a prototype
const anotherObject = Object.create(anObject);

// Create yetAnotherObject using anotherObject as a prototype
const yetAnotherObject = Object.create(anotherObject);

// myProp is found in yetAnotherObject's prototype chain (in anObject)
console.log(yetAnotherObject.myProp); // 2

// myOtherProp can't be found in yetAnotherObject's prototype chain
console.log(yetAnotherObject.myOtherProp); // undefined
```

### The true nature of JavaScript classes

In class-based object-oriented languages like C++, Java and C#, classes are static _blueprints_ (templates). When an object is created, the methods and properties of the class are copied into a new entity, called an _instance_. After instantiation, the newly created object has no relation whatsoever with its class.

JavaScript’s object-oriented model is based on prototypes, not classes, to share properties and delegate behavior between objects. In JavaScript, a class is itself an object, not a static blueprint. “Instantiating” a class creates a new object linked to a prototype object. Regarding classes behavior, the JavaScript language is quite different from C++, Java or C#, but close to other object-oriented languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk.

The JavaScript `class` syntax is merely a more convenient way to create relationships between objects through prototypes. Classes were introduced to emulate the class-based OOP model on top of JavaScript’s own prototype-based model. It’s an example of what programmers call syntactic sugar. The usefulness of the `class` syntax is a pretty heated debate in the JavaScript community.


Following is how a fight will be handled. If attacked, a character sees their life points decrease from the strength of the attacker. If its health value falls below zero, the character is considered dead and cannot attack anymore. Its vanquisher receives a fixed number of 1010 experience points.

First, let’s add the capability for our characters to fight one another. Since it’s a shared ability, we define it as a method named `attack()` in the `Character` class. The `attack()` method checks the health of two fighting characters.

```javascript
class Character {
  constructor(name, health, strength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.health = health;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.xp = 0; // XP is always zero for new characters
  }
  
  // Attack a target
  attack(target) {
    if (this.health > 0) {
      const damage = this.strength;
      console.log(
        `${this.name} attacks ${target.name} and causes ${damage} damage points`
      );
      target.health -= damage;
      if (target.health > 0) {
        console.log(`${target.name} has ${target.health} health points left`);
      } else {
        target.health = 0;
        const bonusXP = 10;
        console.log(
          `${this
            .name} eliminated ${target.name} and wins ${bonusXP} experience points`
        );
        this.xp += bonusXP;
      }
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} can't attack (they've been eliminated)`);
    }
  }

  // Return the character description
  describe() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.health} health points, ${this
      .strength} as strength and ${this.xp} XP points`;
  }
}
```

Now we can introduce a monster in the game and make it fight our players. Here’s the complete final code of our RPG.
```javascript
class Character {
  constructor(name, health, strength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.health = health;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.xp = 0; // XP is always zero for new characters
  }

  // Attack a target
  attack(target) {
    if (this.health > 0) {
      const damage = this.strength;
      console.log(
        `${this.name} attacks ${target.name} and causes ${damage} damage points`
      );
      target.health -= damage;
      if (target.health > 0) {
        console.log(`${target.name} has ${target.health} health points left`);
      } else {
        target.health = 0;
        const bonusXP = 10;
        console.log(
          `${this
            .name} eliminated ${target.name} and wins ${bonusXP} experience points`
        );
        this.xp += bonusXP;
      }
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} can't attack (they've been eliminated)`);
    }
  }
  
  // Return the character description
  describe() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.health} health points, ${this
      .strength} as strength and ${this.xp} XP points`;
  }
}

const aurora = new Character("Aurora", 150, 25);
const glacius = new Character("Glacius", 130, 30);

console.log("Welcome to the adventure! Here are our heroes:");
console.log(aurora.describe());
console.log(glacius.describe());

const monster = new Character("Spike", 40, 20);
console.log("A wild monster has appeared: it's named " + monster.name);

monster.attack(aurora);
monster.attack(glacius);
aurora.attack(monster);
glacius.attack(monster); 

console.log(aurora.describe());
console.log(glacius.describe());
```

Here, we create a new character `monster`, and put it into the fight using the `attack()` method. After calling the `attack()` method, the fight will begin between `monster` and `aurora`. When that fight concludes `glacius` come in.
