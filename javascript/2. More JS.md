## Variables 
A computer program stores data using variables. A _variable_ is an information storage area. 

A variable has three main properties:
- Its _name_, which identifies it. A variable name may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers (not in the first position), and characters like the dollar sign (`$`) or underscore (`_`).
- Its _value_, which is the data stored in the variable.
- Its _type_, which determines the role and actions available to the variable.

==NOTE== : You don’t have to define a variable type explicitly in JavaScript. Its type is deduced from the value stored in the variable and may change while the program runs. That’s why we say that JavaScript is a `dynamically typed` language. Other languages, like C or Java, require variable types to always be defined. This is called `static typing`.

- Declaring a variable means the computer reserves memory in which to store the variable. The program can then read or write data in this memory area by manipulating the variable.
In JavaScript, you declare a variable with the `let` keyword followed by the variable name. In this example, the variable created is called `a`. In previous versions of the language, variables were declared using the `var` keyword. Remember, we can still use `var` keyword to declare variables.

Eg., 
let a;
console.log(a);

Output : undefined
 > Note that the result is `undefined`. This is a special JavaScript type indicating no value. I declared the variable, calling it `a`, but didn’t give it a value!


- Use the `=` operator called the _assignment operator_ 
> We could use Numeric Separators (`_`) for variable values when a value is very large, e.g., 1 trillion. We could do this for binary and hex values too.

- If the initial value of a variable won’t ever change during the rest of program execution, this variable is called a _constant_. This constantness can be enforced by using the keyword `const` instead of `let` to declare it. 

- You can also increase the value of a number with `+=` and `++`. The latter is called the _increment operator_, as it allows incrementation (increase by 1) of a variable’s value.

- The _scope_ of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is visible and usable. Variables declared with `let` or `const` are _block-scoped_: their visibility is limited to the block where they are declared (and every sub-block, if any).

## Expressions 
An _expression_ is a piece of code that produces a value. An expression is created by combining variables, values and operators. Every expression has a value and thus a type. Calculating an expression’s value is called _evaluation_. During evaluation, variables are replaced by their values.
 - Operator priority inside an expression is the same as in math.
 - It is possible to include expressions in a string by using _backticks_ ( `` ` ``) to delimit the string. Such a string is called a _template literal_. Inside a template literal, expressions are identified by the `${expression}` syntax. This is often used to create strings containing the values of some variables.


## Type Conversions
An expression’s evaluation can result in type conversions. These are called _implicit_ conversions, as they happen automatically without the programmer’s intervention. For example, using the `+` operator between a string and a number causes the concatenation of the two values into a string result. 

JavaScript is extremely tolerant in terms of type conversion. However, sometimes conversion isn’t possible. If a value fails to convert into a number, you’ll get the result `NaN` (Not a Number).

Sometimes you’ll wish to convert the value of another type. This is called _explicit_ conversion. JavaScript has the `Number()` and `String()` commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.

JavaScript has another type conversion which is called a boolean conversion. It can convert both _Number_ and _String_ into boolean and vice versa.

## User Interactions
Eg. 
const name = prompt("Enter your first name:");
alert(`Hello, ${name}`);

- Both `console.log()` (encountered in the previous chapter) and `alert()` can be used to display information to the user. Unlike `alert()`, `console.log()` does not stop program execution and is often a better choice.
- Regardless of the entered data, the `prompt()` command always returns a string value. If this value is to be used in numerical expressions, it must be converted into a number with the `Number()` command.

## Conditions
- if statement : 
```cpp
	const number = Number(prompt("Enter a number:"));
	if (number > 0) {
	console.log(`${number} is positive`);
}
```

A _condition_ is an expression that evaluates as a value either true or false: it’s called a _boolean_ value. When the value of a condition is true, we say that this condition is satisfied.

We have already studied numbers and strings, two types of data in JavaScript. Booleans are another type. This type has only two possible values: `true` and `false`.

Any expression producing a boolean value (either `true` or `false`) can be used as a condition in an if statement. If the value of this expression is `true`, the code block associated with it is executed.

> In some other programming languages, equality and inequality operators are `==` and `!=`. They also exist in JavaScript, but it’s safer to use `===` and `!==`

## Repeat Conditions
- while loop
- for loop

## Functions 
A _function_ is a group of statements that performs a particular task.
Eg.,
function sayHello() { 
console.log("Hello!");
}

- Anonymous Functions :
// Assignment of an anonymous function to the myFunc variable
const myFunc = function(param1, param2, ...) {
  // Statements using param1, param2, ...
};
// Anonymous function call
// param1 value is set to arg1, param2 to arg2, ...
myFunc(arg1, arg2, ...);


- Arrow Functions :
 const hello = (name) => {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return message;
};
console.log(hello("William")); // "Hello, William!"

Arrow function syntax can be further simplified in some particular cases:
- When there’s only one statement in the function body, everything can be written on the same line without curly braces. The `return` statement is omitted and implicit.
- When the function accepts only one parameter, parentheses around it can be omitted.
Eg./
const hello = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(hello("Kate")); // "Hello, Kate!"

When we pass two or more parameters to the arrow function, we need to add them in round brackets.  
Let’s run the below code and see how to pass the two parameters in arrow functions.

//Passing two values as parameters to the arrow function
let sum = (x, y) => {
    let result = x + y;
    return result;
} 
let result1 = sum(12,3);
console.log(result1);
