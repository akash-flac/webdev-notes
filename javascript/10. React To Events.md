# Introduction to Events
Up until now, your JavaScript code was executed right from the start. The execution order of statements was determined in advance and only user interactions were passed as input through `prompt()` calls.

To add more interactivity, the page should react to the user’s actions: clicking on a button, filling a form, etc. In that case, the execution order of statements is not determined in advance anymore, but depends on the user behavior. His actions trigger events that can be handled by writing JavaScript code. This way of writing programs is called **event-driven programming**. It is often used by user interfaces, and more generally anytime a program needs to interact with a user.

## Adding an event listener
Called on a DOM element, the `addEventListener()` method adds a _handler_ for a particular event. This method takes as parameter the _event type_ and the associated _function_. This function gets called whenever an event of the corresponding type appears for the DOM element.

```javascript
// Show a message when the user clicks on the button
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Hello!");
});
```

## Removing an event listener
In some particular cases, you might want to stop reacting to an event on a DOM element. To achieve this, call the `removeEventListener()` on the element, passing as a parameter the function which used to handle the event.

> This can only work if the handler function is not anonymous.

```javascript
```

## Categories of events
Many types of events can be triggered by DOM elements. Here are the main event categories.

Every event is associated to an `Event` object which has both _properties_ (information about the event) and _methods_ (ways to act on the event). This object can be used by the handler function.

Many properties of the `Event` object associated to an event depend on the event `type`. Some properties are always present, like `type` that returns the event type and `target` that returns the event target (the DOM element on which the event originally occurred).

The `Event` object is passed as a parameter to the handler function. The parameter name chosen for the `Event` object is generally `e` or `event`. 

```javascript
// Show event type and target when the user clicks on the button

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", e => {

  console.log(`Event type: ${e.type}, target: ${e.target}`);

});
```
