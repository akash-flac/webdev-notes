- JS is a synchronous single-threaded language.
- JavaScript code execution involves creating an execution context with two phases: memory creation and code execution. During memory creation, variables and functions are allocated memory and initialized to undefined. In the code execution phase, values are assigned, functions are invoked, and a call stack manages execution contexts, ensuring proper order and control.
