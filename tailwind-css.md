Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes. These classes enable rapid styling without writing custom CSS, promoting consistency and scalability. Tailwind’s approach shifts focus from traditional CSS components to functional classes, empowering developers to efficiently build responsive and visually appealing interfaces with minimal effort.
